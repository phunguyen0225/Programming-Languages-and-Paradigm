synopsis~: no build file found

Did not find any file to easily compile and run the tests from the command line. Let's start by creating a build file. Also, please place Java related details into a java (lowercase name) directory under assign1.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
