***Please review the top part of ../hw1/hw1.txt***
***Your chance of success greatly increases if you start very early. Your chance of failure increases if you start late. Please use as many reviews as you possibly can.***

For this assignment we will use three different languages. One has to be a statically typed language. One has to be a dynamically typed language. A third is your choice. Do not pick two languages that are too similar to each other. Please drop an email to Venkat to check if your language choices are OK before you invest too much time into any of them.

Create files using proper extensions. Also create either a build file or a sh file that will compile (if necessary) and run your code to display the output or show test results automatically.

If you need help with any of the steps, please ask. You do not have to fight with tools or code for a long time. The purpose of this course is to learn. If you're stuck, then ask for help and it will be given. If you start early, you will be able to make much better progress than if you start late.

Please time box your efforts. Spend at most an hour on a problem, if you can't find a working solution, then ask for help.

In each of the languages, create two implementations for a function that will tell whether a number, given as argument, is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a number greater than 1 whose factors total to twice the number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The total of these values is 12 which is twice the given number 6.

The first implementation, in each language, should be in imperative style. The second implementation, in each language, should be in functional style.

Suggestion: Start with one language. Write the code in that language, evolve it using reviews. Once you've completed code in one language and gotten a satisfactory review, then create in second language. Once that's completed, proceed to the third language.

After completing the coding (and only after that), answer the following questions:

1. Discuss some of the things you have learned from working on this assignment.

Replace this line with your answer.

2. Were there any thing that surprised you or things that you did not expect.

Replace this line with your answer.

3. Given this experience, draw a comparison between the imperative style and the functional style.

Replace this line with your answer.

4. Given this experience, draw a comparison between static typing and dynamic typing.

Replace this line with your answer.

5. Of the three languages that you used, what are your impressions about each, their strengths, weaknesses, your likes/dislikes.

Replace this line with your answer.
